# Data Fetching
- its at the top of files because of preload()
- little abstraction
- allow processing of data on the server AND after initial fetch to format how you want before the data comes to the client

# Tailwind
- grid systems are cool

# Formatters & Linters
- these should be dev-chosen and local to their machine
